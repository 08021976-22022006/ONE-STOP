## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Cloud-Native Intelligent MLOps & FinOps Platform** is designed to **automate machine learning workflows** (MLOps) while also enabling **cloud cost optimization** (FinOps).  
It provides a **unified dashboard** for:  
- Training & deploying ML models  
- Monitoring performance metrics  
- Tracking and optimizing cloud costs in real-time  

This project combines **MERN stack + Cloud + DevOps** to deliver scalability, automation, and business value.  

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
- Traditional ML workflows are **slow, manual, and error-prone**.  
- Cloud spending grows **unpredictably** without visibility.  
- No **single dashboard** to manage ML models and cloud costs together.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
✅ Automates end-to-end **MLOps lifecycle** (train → deploy → monitor)  
✅ Integrates **FinOps practices** for cloud cost tracking & optimization  
✅ Provides a **single pane of glass** for both ML performance & costs  
✅ Built on **cloud-native infrastructure** (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD)
